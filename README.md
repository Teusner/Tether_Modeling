# Research Initiation : Unextensible tether modeling

## Introduction

This repository is the result of an introduction to research in the field of tether modeling for simulators of multi-marine systems. The goal is to be able to digitally simulate the behavior of an inextensible tether in order to integrate it into a more complex simulation environment using marine and underwater robots.
