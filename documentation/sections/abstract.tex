Simulation in the field of robotics is a powerful tool. Indeed, it allows to easily and quickly test the robot in different conditions and to have a reproducibility of the results. Finally it let us be able to create situations that would be difficult to find in reality, in order to make sure of the robot's behavior. It should be noticed that the simulation of robots does not replace tests in real conditions, but it remains practical during the development phase. However, the simulation of robots in the maritime environment is a field that still has shortcomings, especially when we want to simulate the tethers of submarine robots. This scientific paper presents a method to model this rigid tether in order to build a simulation environment for autonomous underwater robots.
