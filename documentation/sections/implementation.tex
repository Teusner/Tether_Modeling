As for the implementation, it is available in the same GitHub repository and offers a simulator coded in Python3. The goal of this simulator is to study the viability of such a system, in particular to validate the performance of the tether with this behavioral model.

So we will create a class \textit{TetherElement} which will represent a node. It will have to contain its mass, volume and distance information from its neighbors, but also its position, velocity and acceleration, as well as a pointer to each of its two neighbors.

This will allow us later on to implement a \textit{Tether} class to be able to simulate a tether. This object must have a length, a number of elements and a list containing the different \textit{TetherElement} that compose it. It must also know the mass, the volume of each node in order to correctly instantiate the \textit{TetherElement}, but also the length of each link between nodes.
