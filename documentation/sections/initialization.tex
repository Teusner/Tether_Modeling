Initialization is an important step because if the initial position of each TetherElement is random, the Tether will take a long time to converge and the system will be inconsistent. This is mainly due to the fact that the coefficients of the behavioral model are set to keep the nodes at a good distance from each other when a small perturbation is brought to the system.

To initialize the different nodes, we use the catenary equation. The idea is to use the shape taken by a rope attached at the ends to two fixed coordinate points. This rope will want to minimize its energy and so it takes this shape. This chain should check the following second order differential equation.

$$\ddot y = \sqrt{1 + \dot y}$$
