Design/methodology/approach – Unlike the assumed polynomial displacement interpolation functions, the present approach uses the analytical cable dynamic stiffness matrix to obtain the explicit expression of the static stiffness matrix of an inclined sagging cable by setting the frequency at zero. The Newton-Raphson-based iterative method is used to obtain the solution.},

	title = {Development of the mathematical modeling method for dynamics of the flexible tether as an element of the underwater complex},
	doi = {10.15587/1729-4061.2017.90291},
	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of flexible tethers (FT) is an integral part of the study of remotely operated vehicles and underwater complexes in general. In this paper, for the mathematical modeling of the FT dynamics in the flow of liquid, the FT is represented as a set of series-connected elements – solid bodies. The governing equation of the FT element motion is given; it takes into account the external gravity, buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag forces, and internal constraint reaction forces between adjacent elements. The main problem in the inextensible FT modeling is to determine the constraint reaction forces. There has been suggested the method of mathematical modeling of the flexible tether dynamics with automatic control of its elements axial motion (ACEAM). According to the ACEAM method, the flexible tether is represented as a multidimensional automatic control system. The controlled object is the set of the FT elements, the controlled parameters are the distances between adjacent elements, and the controlling parameters are the constraint reaction forces. With the help of the inverse dynamics method, the regulator of the FT elements axial motion is synthesized as a part of the FT mathematical model. The developed regulator provides highly precise control of the distances between the FT elements and, therefore, accurate modeling of the inextensible flexible tether dynamics. The method of the flexible tether simulation considering that its length varies during its operation is suggested. The basis of the method is the dynamic change of the number of the elements being involved in the calculation process, considering the current length of the released part of the FT. Changing the FT length causes additional loads on its inboard and running ends. Taking into account these loads allows accurate simulation of the dynamics of the FT impact on remotely operated vehicles and other components of underwater complexes. The flexible tether motion dynamics is then modeled with the developed method. The modeling results are compared with the method of lumped masses springs. It is established that when the equal precision of the inextensible FT simulation is provided, the suggested method operates about 25 times faster than the method of lumped masses and springs.},

  abstract = {The dynamic simulation of mechanical effects has a long history in computer graphics. The classical methods in this field discretize Newton's second law in a variety of Lagrangian or Eulerian ways, and formulate forces appropriate for each mechanical effect: joints for rigid bodies; stretching, shearing or bending for deformable bodies and pressure, or viscosity for fluids, to mention just a few. In the last years, the class of position-based methods has become popular in the graphics community. These kinds of methods are fast, stable and controllable which make them well-suited for use in interactive environments. Position-based methods are not as accurate as force-based methods in general but they provide visual plausibility. Therefore, the main application areas of these approaches are virtual reality, computer games and special effects in movies. This state-of-the-art report covers the large variety of position-based methods that were developed in the field of physically based simulation. We will introduce the concept of position-based dynamics, present dynamic simulation based on shape matching and discuss data-driven upsampling approaches. Furthermore, we will present several applications for these methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a set of general Newtonian equations which govern the simulation of movement of a body represented by n open chain links. The input for the simulation consisted of the joint moment of force histories, lengths, masses and moments of inertia, the initial absolute angular displacements and velocities and, for the fixed or constrained axis of the nth segment, the acceleration history. Angular accelerations were then determined by solving n linear equations simultaneously, and angular velocities and displacements determined by integrating forwards. The final output was in the form of a graphical display of the linked figure. Applications of the simulation were demonstrated using three-segment representations of movements of the upper and lower extremities and a five-segment representation of a jump. Good agreement was achieved between the displayed angular displacements for the original and simulated movements. The potential for varying the input data has been examined and the implications of anticipating the effects of changed torques, inertial characteristics including attached prosthetic or sports implements and/or the initial conditions for a movement are discussed.}

These flight trajectories yield a baseline for analyzing takeoff or landing performance. In this paper, we optimize for a landing strategy that uses the winch to decelerate the aircraft after touchdown. A complete optimal control formulation with differential algebraic equations for the system dynamics is derived. For avoiding tether collision with the ground, we employ a quasi-static tether model that treats both the tether sag and elasticity. It is a novelty in airborne wind energy trajectory optimization to solve for the tether shape as part of the optimization problem.},
