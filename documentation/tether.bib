	abstract = {A computational model is developed to simulate the dynamics of variable length tether in a tethered underwater vehicle system. The system is comprised of a surface ship and winch, a slender armoured cable that links the surface ship and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and the ROV itself. The cable is considered to be variable length to facilitate paying out and reeling in maneuvers. The motion equation for variable length tether is obtained from Newton's second law of motion for variable mass systems. Unlike many existing formulations, the model can treat the rapid deployment of tether accurately. The weighted residual finite element technique is applied to the continuous motion equation to obtain a system of spatially discrete nonlinear second order differential equations. Time domain simulation of simple payout maneuvers is used to validate the variable length tether model: conservation of internal strain energy is shown to hold over a deployment of the tethered system. The model is applied to the development of a dynamic positioning system. A decoupled controller incorporating a Dahlin compensator for positioning in the longitudinal plane and a PD controller for depth regulation, produces ship motion and winch activity to position an underwater point on the tether, called the control node. It is shown that the use of the control system to regulate the position of the control node brings about significant reduction in the disturbance force exerted by the tether on the ROV during a station-keeping maneuver},

A complete optimal control formulation with differential algebraic equations for the system dynamics is derived. For avoiding tether collision with the ground, we employ a quasi-static tether model that treats both the tether sag and elasticity. It is a novelty in airborne wind energy trajectory optimization to solve for the tether shape as part of the optimization problem.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework for simulating visually realistic motion of underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in highly complex models of aquatic environments. The models include a wide range of objects such as rocks, fish and marine plankton in addition to an ROV tether. A modified cable simulation for the underwater physical conditions has been developed for a tethered ROV. The simulation framework also incorporates models for low visibility conditions and intrinsic camera effects unique to the underwater environment. The visual models were implemented using the Unreal Engine 4 realistic game engine to be part of the presented framework. We developed a generalized method for implementing an ROV dynamics model and this method serves as a highly configurable component inside our framework. In this paper, we explore the unique characteristics of underwater simulation and the specialized models we developed for that environment. We use computer vision algorithms for feature extraction and feature tracking as a probe for comparing experiments done in our simulated environment against real underwater experiments. The experimental results presented in this paper successfully demonstrate the contribution of this realistic simulation framework to the understanding, analysis and development of computer vision and control algorithms to be used in today’s ROVs.},

	title = {Development of the mathematical modeling method for dynamics of the flexible tether as an element of the underwater complex},
	doi = {10.15587/1729-4061.2017.90291},
	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of flexible tethers (FT) is an integral part of the study of remotely operated vehicles and underwater complexes in general. In this paper, for the mathematical modeling of the FT dynamics in the flow of liquid, the FT is represented as a set of series-connected elements – solid bodies. The governing equation of the FT element motion is given; it takes into account the external gravity, buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag forces, and internal constraint reaction forces between adjacent elements. The main problem in the inextensible FT modeling is to determine the constraint reaction forces. There has been suggested the method of mathematical modeling of the flexible tether dynamics with automatic control of its elements axial motion (ACEAM). According to the ACEAM method, the flexible tether is represented as a multidimensional automatic control system. The controlled object is the set of the FT elements, the controlled parameters are the distances between adjacent elements, and the controlling parameters are the constraint reaction forces. With the help of the inverse dynamics method, the regulator of the FT elements axial motion is synthesized as a part of the FT mathematical model. The developed regulator provides highly precise control of the distances between the FT elements and, therefore, accurate modeling of the inextensible flexible tether dynamics. The method of the flexible tether simulation considering that its length varies during its operation is suggested. The basis of the method is the dynamic change of the number of the elements being involved in the calculation process, considering the current length of the released part of the FT. Changing the FT length causes additional loads on its inboard and running ends. Taking into account these loads allows accurate simulation of the dynamics of the FT impact on remotely operated vehicles and other components of underwater complexes. The flexible tether motion dynamics is then modeled with the developed method. The modeling results are compared with the method of lumped masses springs. It is established that when the equal precision of the inextensible FT simulation is provided, the suggested method operates about 25 times faster than the method of lumped masses and springs.},

Any number of concentrated and distributed loadings can be treated in an exact manner. Effects such as temperature change, movement of the supports, and slipping of the cable are readily included and the method can be applied to nonuniform cables and cables of composite construction. The generality and accuracy of the method, when coupled with the speed of a digital computer, provides a powerful tool for the solution of any suspended cable problem. The method has been successfully applied to the analysis of complex loading systems on freely suspended cables and has been used as a basic subprogram for the analysis of pretensioned cable trusses and deep-sea mooring systems. Excellent agreement has been obtained with tests performed on experimental models of each of these types of structures. For loadings distributed uniformly along the length of the cable, the general equations reduce to direct formulas without significant loss of accuracy.},
