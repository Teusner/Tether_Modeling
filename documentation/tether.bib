	abstract = {Autonomous takeoff and landing is a big challenge in the field of airborne wind energy. We propose numerical methods in order to optimize flight trajectories of a tethered aircraft. These flight trajectories yield a baseline for analyzing takeoff or landing performance. In this paper, we optimize for a landing strategy that uses the winch to decelerate the aircraft after touchdown. A complete optimal control formulation with differential algebraic equations for the system dynamics is derived. For avoiding tether collision with the ground, we employ a quasi-static tether model that treats both the tether sag and elasticity. It is a novelty in airborne wind energy trajectory optimization to solve for the tether shape as part of the optimization problem.},

	title = {Dynamics modeling and control of a variable length remotely operated vehicle tether},
	doi = {10.1109/OCEANS.2005.1639927},
	abstract = {A computational model is developed to simulate the dynamics of variable length tether in a tethered underwater vehicle system. The system is comprised of a surface ship and winch, a slender armoured cable that links the surface ship and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and the ROV itself. The cable is considered to be variable length to facilitate paying out and reeling in maneuvers. The motion equation for variable length tether is obtained from Newton's second law of motion for variable mass systems. Unlike many existing formulations, the model can treat the rapid deployment of tether accurately. The weighted residual finite element technique is applied to the continuous motion equation to obtain a system of spatially discrete nonlinear second order differential equations. Time domain simulation of simple payout maneuvers is used to validate the variable length tether model: conservation of internal strain energy is shown to hold over a deployment of the tethered system. The model is applied to the development of a dynamic positioning system. A decoupled controller incorporating a Dahlin compensator for positioning in the longitudinal plane and a PD controller for depth regulation, produces ship motion and winch activity to position an underwater point on the tether, called the control node. It is shown that the use of the control system to regulate the position of the control node brings about significant reduction in the disturbance force exerted by the tether on the ROV during a station-keeping maneuver},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework for simulating visually realistic motion of underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in highly complex models of aquatic environments. The models include a wide range of objects such as rocks, fish and marine plankton in addition to an ROV tether. A modified cable simulation for the underwater physical conditions has been developed for a tethered ROV. The simulation framework also incorporates models for low visibility conditions and intrinsic camera effects unique to the underwater environment. The visual models were implemented using the Unreal Engine 4 realistic game engine to be part of the presented framework. We developed a generalized method for implementing an ROV dynamics model and this method serves as a highly configurable component inside our framework. In this paper, we explore the unique characteristics of underwater simulation and the specialized models we developed for that environment. We use computer vision algorithms for feature extraction and feature tracking as a probe for comparing experiments done in our simulated environment against real underwater experiments. The experimental results presented in this paper successfully demonstrate the contribution of this realistic simulation framework to the understanding, analysis and development of computer vision and control algorithms to be used in todayâ€™s ROVs.},
